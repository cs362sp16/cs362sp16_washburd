Function: council_room_test

Adds 5 cards to hand, rather than 4.
Moderate priority and severity, does not cause the program to crash or anything, but does meaningfully impact the game when played.

Changes:	//Change for loop from '5' to '4'
-	for (i = 0; i < 5; i++) {
-	drawCard(currentPlayer, state);
-	}

+	for (i = 0; i < 4; i++) {
+	drawCard(currentPlayer, state);
+	}
